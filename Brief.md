To create a Predictive Business Intelligence Tool using Tableau

ASU Admission Services manages and fulfills the mission of recruitment for all undergrad and graduate degrees at ASU. 
In facilitating this mission, ASU attracts over 100,000 applications per year. Many different areas are the focus of 
recruitment and outreach efforts, Arizona Residents, International, Native Americans, Non-residential to name a couple 
markets are targeted with enrollment goals tied to each group. Applicant students are contacted through mail, email and 
call campaigns in a Salesforce Customer Relationship Management system in order to drive interest, create application 
submittals and finally convince students to select ASU for their higher Ed destination.

The goals of this project are as follows:
 
•	Identify data points needed to measure effectiveness recruitment efforts.
• Target focus – International Students only
•	Identify top markets and areas for potential growth and/or areas of poor return.
•	Prepare data driven recommendation for changes, additions, and/or alterations to efforts.
•	Build an analytics model that enables ASU to clearly identify cost benefit for recruitment efforts, as well being able to drill down and understand cost/benefit for individual markets
•	Provision of predictive analytics and a model for extending this, to identify patterns that can be used to predict and understand impact of future market targeting.
